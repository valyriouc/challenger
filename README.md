# Challenger

Social challenges platform built with ASP.NET Core. Users create challenges for followers/friends; participants join and submit proofs to complete them.

## Features

- Create, browse, and search public or invite-only challenges
- Join challenges, submit proofs (text/image/link), comment, react
- Follows, feeds, and notifications (optional real-time via SignalR)
- User profiles, privacy controls, and reporting
- Moderation: flagging and basic abuse prevention hooks
- JWT authentication with ASP.NET Core Identity
- EF Core data access and migrations

## Tech stack

- .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API (or MVC)
- EF Core (SQL Server or SQLite)
- ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT
- SignalR (optional) for real-time updates
- Serilog (optional) for logging
